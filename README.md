# AWS Rakes

Rake tasks for simplified command line interaction with AWS using published AWS Ruby SDKs.

## Prerequisites

This project has been written, tested, and run exclusively on MacOS. The instructions below follow accordingly.  It should run well on other *nix OSes, and on Windows too, with some adjustments.

* Recommended: Homebrew, if you are on MacOs.  See https://brew.sh/
* awscli installed and configured, e.g. `brew install awscli`
* AWS programatic access via key and secret, normally saveds in ~/.aws/config
* IAM permissions for the specific services you wish to query
* ruby installed, with gems rake and bundler (these are pre-installed with current ruby versions)
* Optional: a ruby version manager, e.g. chruby or rbenv
  * chruby install directions below in Installation
  * RVM is not recommended

## Installation

### Install
* clone the repo into your desired directory `git clone `
* install chruby - see docs at https://github.com/postmodern/chruby
  * `brew install chruby ruby-build ruby-install wget`
  * add to your shell.rc: 
  
```
 source /usr/local/share/chruby/chruby.sh
 source /usr/local/share/chruby/auto.sh
```

* (re-)source your shell.rc, e.g. `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc`

* Install specified ruby version: 

```
ruby-install ruby `cat .aws_utils/.ruby-version`
```
* Optional: install other rubies according to preference
* `cd aws_utils`
* confirm ruby version: `ruby -v`
* run `bundle install` (if you are using system ruby, `sudo bundle install`)

## Usage

### Rake tasks

Note: Follow the installation instuctions above, and you should not need to prefix `bundle exec` to your `rake` commands, since the gems will be installed in a common location for the ruby, not in an application-specific location, e.g vendor/bundle.

If you do need `bundle exec` it is helpful to create an alias in your shell.rc e.g. `alias be="bundle exec "`.  This done, you can substitute 'be' for 'bundle exec' in your rake commands.

* Display all available rake tasks: `rake -T`
* to filter for specific AWS resources, add argument, e.g. `rake -T ec2`

#### Multifactor authentication

If your AWS account requires MFA for CLI access, you will be prompted to set up an MFA session interactively, to set a new session token.  You will need your AWS username, and the 6 digit rotating token from your MFA device.

### Caching

* To improve performance results are cached for 30 minutes locally.  
* The expiration time can be changed by updating cache\_expire\_minutes in config/config.yaml
* To force no caching for any rake task, append 'cache=no', e.g. `rake ec2s:new cache=no`

### Audit

* Display all audit tasks: `rake -T audit`

## Development and Testing

* Run `bundle exec rake spec` to run the tests
* You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment with objects

## Acknowledgements

* Thanks to Jason Davila for the original bash scripts which inspired this project.

## Todo

* add some intelligent tests, maybe?
